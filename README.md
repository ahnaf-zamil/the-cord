# The Cord

My attempt at making a scalable distributed chat service like Discord.

## Technologies

- TypeScript (To make sure undefined errors don't make me wanna die)
- PostgreSQL (For storing application data)
- Redis (For storing server-sided session)
- NATS (For pub/sub between microservices)

## License

Don't steal my code plase. If you do, at least credit it. The boring legal stuff is in the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file;
